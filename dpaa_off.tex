\normalsize
\noindent{\it Last Revised: March 25, 2016}\\
\noindent{\bf Filename: dpaa\_off} \\


\noindent {\bf BRIEF FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:} \\
\normalsize
This is an ``atomic'' procedure which simply turns off the DPA side A.
It should be safe to execute under any
condition except a spacecraft power or thermal emergency.
The telemetry verifiers for the ``Enable'' and ``On''  can be
confusing depending on if either side of the DPA was on before the
procedure started.  If only side A was on before the procedure, the Enable and
On will read Enabled and On even after the off command had been
executed.  If side B was on before, during and after this procedure,
the Enable and On will change state to Disabled and Off at the end of
this procedure. Therefore, the only sure way to tell is to check the input
current and the DPA 5V.

\vspace{0.25in}
\noindent The sequence of actions will be:
\be
\item  turn off and disable DPA power supply side A
\ee


\vspace{0.15in}
\normalsize
\noindent {\bf ASSUMED INSTRUMENT STATE:} \\
\normalsize
Assumes that the PSMC has power from the spacecraft. \\
The FEPs for side A (\# 0,1,2) should be off. \\

%\vspace{0.25in}
\normalsize
\noindent {\bf SPECIAL INITIAL CONDITIONS:} \\
\normalsize
%The environment must be clean enough to allow opening of the valve. \\
%Assumes that \axaf\/ ISIM RCTU is powered on and in telemetry format 6. \\
