\centerline{\large {\bf \textcolor{red}{5.9\_V2.2} SWITCH FROM DEA A TO DEA B }}
\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent{\it Last Revised: June 17, 2016}\\
\noindent{\bf Filename: switch\_deaa\_b} \\


\noindent{\bf BRIEF FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:}\\

\textcolor{red}{This is a contingency procedure to switch from powering the DEA from the
A-side of the PSMC to powering it from the B-side.
After switching DEA input power and reestablishing control of the
focal plane heaters, the magnetic relays that control pairs
of video boards are thrown one at a time,
and those two video boards are powered up separately,
while verifying that the PSMC doesn't report a current overflow.}

\vspace{0.15in}

\noindent The sequence of actions will be:
{\color{red}
\begin{itemize}
\item Power down the video boards (skip if not powered)

\item Turn off and disable the DEA side A power supply (skip if not enabled and on)

\item Verify that all DEA side B heaters are off and disabled

\item Enable and turn on the DEA side B power supply

\item Perform a warm boot of the active BEP

\item Start DEA interface housekeeping

\item Enable DEA-B to assume control of the focal plane temperature
by commanding it to $-122^\circ$~C and then to $-120^\circ$~C

\item Switch the video board relays one at a time,
wait for PSMC telemetry verifiers to refresh,
and verify that DEA-B hasn't powered down due to an overcurrent
or overvoltage condition

\item After switching each pair of video boards,
power up each of the two boards, waiting for PSMC telemetry verifiers to refresh,
and verifying that DEA-B hasn't powered down due to an overcurrent
or overvoltage condition

\item Power down all video boards

\item Dump the system configuration table
\end{itemize}
}

\vspace{0.15in}

\noindent{\bf ASSUMED INSTRUMENT STATE:}
\bi
\item Assumes that DPA A and/or DPA B is on and that the flight SW is running.
\item \sout{Assumes that DEA A is on.}
\ei

\vspace{0.15in}

\noindent{\bf SPECIAL INITIAL CONDITIONS:}
{\color{red}
\bi
\item Assumes that telemetry is in Format 1 or 2.
\item Assumes that neither the bakeout heater nor the detector housing heater is
being powered by DEA-B. If they are, switch them off and, if the procedure ends
with the DEA powered from DEA-B, consider enabling and turning them on again
on DEA-A.

\newpage

\noindent{\bf CHANGE HISTORY:}

\bd
\item {\bf Version 1.2}
\bi
\item added a new step 1 to start a DEA HKP run if necessary
\item changed HW TLM verifiers to check state of DEA A and DEA B in
steps 2.1 and 3.2
\item added a new step 5 to warmboot the active BEP
\item added a command in step 6 to set the focal plane temperature to
$-120^\circ$~C
\item added operational constraint/caution that the B side does not
produce the telltales to verify the state of the relays
\ei

\item {\bf Version 2.0}
\bi
\item ACIS Team signed-off version
\item changed expected value of ``1STAT7ST'' in step 5.6
\ei

\item {\bf Version 2.1}
\bi
\item changed comment in step 1.2 to read ``check FP temp''
\item changed telemetry verified in step 5.5 to read ``version=??''
  and changed comment to read ``version \# depends on loaded patches,
  if any''
\item changed expected value of ``1STAT7ST'' in step 5.6
\item changed command in step 6.2 to WSFTNEG121
\item added to ``Assumed Instrument State'', ``Assumes DEA A is on''
\ei

{\color{red}
\item {\bf Version 2.2}
\bi
\item added explicit step to verify that 28V heaters are off before powering DEA-B
\item replaced warm boot with FP temperature changes
\item replaced command to switch all 5 relays simultaneously with 5 sets of 3 commands:
a command to switch one of the relays,
followed by a pair of commands to power up each of the two boards controlled by that relay
\item added command to power up 6 FEPs
\item added bias-only run to acquire housekeeping from ACIS-I boards
\item added bias-only run to acquire housekeeping from ACIS-S boards
\item added command to power down all video boards
