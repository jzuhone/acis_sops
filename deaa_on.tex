\noindent {\bf BRIEF FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:} \\
\normalsize
This is an ``atomic'' procedure which simply powers up the DEA side A.
It should be safe to execute under any condition except a spacecraft 
power or thermal emergency.

\vspace{0.25in}
\noindent The sequence of actions for this procedure will be:
\be
\item Verify that DEA B is powered off and disabled (see Constraints/Cautions, below)
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Verify that DEA A is receiving power from the spacecraft
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Enable and turn on DEA power supply side A
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Verify that DEA B is still off
\ee

\vspace{0.15in}
\normalsize
\noindent {\bf ASSUMED INSTRUMENT STATE:}
\normalsize
\be
\item Assumes that the PSMC has power from the spacecraft.
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Assumes that DEA B is off.
\ee
\vspace{0.1in}
\normalsize
\noindent {\bf SPECIAL INITIAL CONDITIONS:} \\
\normalsize
%The environment must be clean enough to allow opening of the valve. \\
%Assumes that \axaf\/ ISIM RCTU is powered on and in telemetry format 6. \\

%\vspace{0.25in}
\normalsize
\noindent {\bf OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS/CAUTIONS:} \\
\normalsize

In normal operations, only one side of the DEA should be powered on
(a) to prevent conflict for control of the focal plane temperature controller,
(b) to avoid excess current draw from the spacecraft, and (c) to avoid over-heating
within the PSMC.

The DEA power status is normally indicated by the values of the 1DEPSA and
1DEPSB flags, which should not both be 1 simultaneously.
However, if neither side of the DPA is receiving power
({\it i.e.}, if 1DPP0AVO and 1DPP0BVO are simultaneously reading $0.0 \pm 0.5$ V),
the DEA flag values will be unreliable and the DEA voltage
channels (1DEP[0123][AB]VO) should instead be used to determine which
sides of the DEA are powered).

Before sending the command to power on DEA A, the DEA Input Voltage A 1DE28AVO should
be checked to make sure that DEA A is receiving power from the spacecraft.

The DEA input current monitors (1DEIC[AB]CU) are noisy.
To give an indication of what variation may be expected, figures 1 and 2
show the behavior of the A-side DEA current with a ten-sample running
average for two situations in which all video boards were powered down. Note that
when either side of the DEA is unpowered, the corresponding current monitor, 
1DEICACU for side A, or 1DEICBCU for side B, will be unreliable. They will read
16--18~A when unpowered, as of Telemetry Database (TDB) v14. This is expected and
not a problem.

If the DEA powers off unexpectedly during a bakeout, the FP bakeout 
heater will lose power and this heater will NOT be re-enabled when the DEA side A 
power is restored. Additional SW commands are necessary to activate the FP bakeout 
heater. The DH bakeout heater is unaffected by a power loss to the DEA and will 
therefore still be executing a bakeout if power is lost to the DEA.

After successful execution, {\em the FP temperature control will be unregulated,
and DEA interface A/D will be in low-resolution mode.}\\
