\centerline {\bf 4.29\_V2.2 TURN ON DEA A AND TEST VIDEO BOARDS }
\vspace{0.25in}

\normalsize
\noindent{\it Last Revised: July 21, 2017}\\
\noindent{\bf Filename: deaa\_on\_test\_vid} \\


\noindent {\bf BRIEF FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:} \\
\normalsize

This is a procedure which powers up the DEA side A, powers up all 10 video boards, and powers up all 6 FEPs. It then executes an ACIS-I bias-only science run and an ACIS-S bias-only science run in order to get calibrated housekeeping data from the video boards. It then powers down all video boards and FEPs. It should be safe to execute under any condition except a spacecraft power or thermal emergency.

\vspace{0.25in}
\noindent The sequence of actions for this procedure will be:
\be
\item Verify that DEA B is powered off and disabled (see Constraints/Cautions, below)
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item {\color{red} Verify that DEA A is receiving power from the spacecraft}
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Enable and turn on DEA power supply side A
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Verify that DEA B is still off
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Verify that the DH heater is not powered from side A
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item {\color{red} Warm boot the BEP}
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item {\color{red} Execute a DEA housekeeping run}
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item {\color{red} Set the focal plane temperature to -119.7~$^\circ$C}
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Power up all 10 video boards
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Execute two bias-only science runs to capture video housekeeping
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Power down the 10 video boards and the 6 FEPs
\ee

\noindent {\bf ASSUMED INSTRUMENT STATE:} \\
\normalsize
\be
\item Assumes that the PSMC has power from the spacecraft.
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Assumes that DEA B is off.
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Assumes that both sides of the DPA are on.
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item Assumes that the flight SW is running on the active BEP.
\vspace{-0.10in}
\item {\color{red} Assumes that the DEA was previously powered from side A.}

\normalsize
\noindent {\bf OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS/CAUTIONS:} \\
\normalsize

In normal operations, only one side of the DEA should be powered on
(a) to prevent conflict for control of the focal plane temperature controller,
(b) to avoid excess current draw from the spacecraft, and (c) to avoid over-heating
within the PSMC.

The DEA power status is normally indicated by the values of the 1DEPSA and
1DEPSB flags, which should not both be 1 simultaneously.

The DEA input current monitors (1DEIC[AB]CU) are noisy.
To give an indication of what variation may be expected, figures 1 and 2
show the behavior of the A-side DEA current with a ten-sample running
average for two situations in which all video boards were powered down. Note that
when either side of the DEA is unpowered, the corresponding current monitor, 
1DEICACU for side A, or 1DEICBCU for side B, will be unreliable. They will read
16--18~A when unpowered, as of Telemetry Database (TDB) v14. This is expected and
not a problem.

{\color{red} If the DEA powers off unexpectedly during a bakeout, the FP bakeout 
heater will lose power and this heater will NOT be re-enabled when the DEA side A 
power is restored. Additional SW commands are necessary to activate the FP bakeout 
heater. The DH bakeout heater is unaffected by a power loss to the DEA and will 
therefore still be executing a bakeout if power is lost to the DEA.}

After successful execution, {\em the FP temperature control will be unregulated,
and DEA interface A/D will be in {\color{red} high-resolution mode.}}\\

{\bf V2.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Branched off from ``deaa\_on'' atomic procedure V2.2
\item Add commands to power video boards on and off
\item Add bias-only science runs
\end{itemize}

{\bf V2.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added a step to verify DEA-B is off at the beginning of the procedure
\item Added text regarding power status issues and expected current behavior to the Operational Constraints/Cautions section. Also updated the expected FP temperature control.
\item Removed language about what to do if the DPA is unpowered since we do not expect to run this procedure if that is the case.
\item Removed input current check for DEA B; added warning to text.
\item Corrected introduction to indicate that we will be powering down all video boards and all FEPs at the end
\item Corrected numbering in table: 5.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.2
\item Corrected number of FEPMAN\_POWEROFF messages in Step 6.1 of the table
\end{itemize}
